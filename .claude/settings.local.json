Extract metadata into MetadataHolder base class.\nRemove dead parallel edge code from TopoEdge, clean up empty constraint\ndeduction logic, and replace magic safety limit with named constant.\nFix OccView node discovery to use EntityOwner for O\\(1\\) identification.\n\nCo-Authored-By: Claude Opus 4.6 <noreply@anthropic.com>\nEOF\n\\)\")"
